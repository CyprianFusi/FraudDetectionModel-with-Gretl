# FraudDetectionModel using Gretl

In this notebook I use a publickly available dataset 'FraudDetection.xlsx'to create a fraud detection model.

I used Python in the first phase to prepare the data and split it into training and test datasets.

Then I use **Gretl** to create the model and extract the required predictions for further processing using Python.

The **Cumulative Accuary Profile (CAP)** curve was produced using excel.

The accuary of the model on both training and test dataset is above **90%** with no signs of overfitting!!!
